## 👋 Hello and welcome!

🔭 I’m working on web-based projects that blend **UI/UX design** and **backend engineering**.  
⚙️ I build with **JavaScript**, **Laravel**, and **MySQL**, while exploring **Next.js** and **API design**.  
💬 Open for **collaboration** and **UI/UX discussions**, always up for creative problem-solving.  
📂 Contributions are welcome.  
💖 *One commit at a time, we build the future.*
