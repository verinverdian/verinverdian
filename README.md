## 👋 Hi there, I’m Verdian

🔭 I'm currently working on web-based projects that bridge **UI/UX design** and **backend engineering**
⚙️ I’ve been building and maintaining several projects using **JavaScript**, **PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)**, and **MySQL**, with a growing interest in **Next.js** and **API design**.  
💬 You can reach out for **collaboration**, **code discussions**, or **UI/UX feedback**. I’m always open to new ideas and problem-solving.  
📂 For **open-source works**, contributions are welcome as long as you keep things clean, documented, and collaborative.  
💖 Developers build the future one commit at a time. If my projects inspire you, a ⭐ or small support means a lot!
